## 🧠 Personalized Event Recommendation System

MyEventHub implements a **rule-based personalization engine** that ensures each user sees events in a **unique order** based on their previous interactions.

---

### 🎯 Personalization Signals Used

- **Liked Events**  
  Increases preference for similar events in future recommendations.

- **Joined Events**  
  Strongly boosts the recommendation score for related events.

- **Category Affinity**  
  Events from categories the user frequently interacts with are ranked higher.

---

### 📊 Personalization Scoring Logic

Each event receives a **personalization score** per user using the formula: Score = (3 × Joined) + (2 × Liked)

Events are dynamically sorted in **descending order of personalization score**, ensuring that the most relevant events appear first for each user.

---

### ✅ Key Characteristics

- Different users see different event orders  
- Personalization is computed dynamically per request  
- Lightweight and fully explainable (no ML models)  
- Suitable for college-scale datasets  


## 🔍 Information Retrieval (IR) Based Search System

Search is implemented using **PostgreSQL Full-Text Search (FTS)**, not Django ORM filtering.

---

### ⚙️ How Search Works

- PostgreSQL native **Full-Text Search**
- Text is converted to `tsvector` using `to_tsvector`
- Indexed fields:
  - `title`
  - `description`
- Query parsing via `plainto_tsquery`
- Ranking performed using **`ts_rank_cd` relevance scoring**
- Optimized with a **GIN index**

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters

| Traditional ORM Search | EventHub Search |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `LIKE '%text%'` | Full-text token search |
| Full table scan | GIN-indexed lookup |
| No ranking | Relevance-based ranking |
| Slow at scale | Optimized and scalable |

---

### 🧪 Example SQL Used

```sql
SELECT id,
       ts_rank_cd(
         to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(description,'')),
         plainto_tsquery('english', %s)
       ) AS rank
FROM "Event_event"
WHERE to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(description,'')) @@
      plainto_tsquery('english', %s)
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 20;

```
## 📈 Search vs Recommendation: Clear Separation of Concerns

| Feature | 🔍 Search System (FTS) | 🧠 Personalized Feed |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 🎯 Purpose | Explicit user query | Event discovery |
| 🛠️ Technique | PostgreSQL FTS + relevance ranking | Rule-based scoring |
| 🗄️ Database Use | Inverted text index (GIN) | Relational joins |
| 📊 Ordering | Relevance score | Personalization score |
| ⚡ Performance | Very fast | Acceptable for current scale |

---

## 🔁 Index Consistency & Maintenance

- Search index is maintained automatically by **PostgreSQL**
- GIN index stays consistent on:
  - **INSERT**
  - **UPDATE**
  - **DELETE**
- No manual triggers or background re-indexing required

This reduces application complexity and improves reliability.

## ⚙️ Architecture

</p>

### 🌐 Presentation Layer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Responsible for **user interaction and UI rendering**
- Built using **Django templates**
- Displays events, comments, and chat messages
- Sends user actions (login, join event, send message) to the backend via **HTTP requests**
- Contains **no business logic** — only data rendering and form submission

---

### ⚙️ Application Layer (Django Views, URLs)
- Acts as the **request–response controller**
- Django views receive HTTP requests from the frontend
- URL routing maps requests to appropriate views
- Handles **form validation, request parsing, and response generation**
- Serves as the **bridge between UI and business logic**

---

### 🧠 Business Logic Layer (User App & Event App)
- Personalized recommendation logic based on user interactions (likes and participation)
- Separate pipelines for search (IR-based) and browsing (personalization-based)
- Core layer where **application rules are enforced**
- Structured into two Django apps:
  - **User App**: authentication, authorization, user profiles
  - **Event App**: event creation, joining, comments, and chat access
- Enforces rules such as:
  - Only joined users can access chatrooms
  - Comments can be enabled or disabled per event
- Keeps **domain logic separate** from views and templates

---

### 🛡️ Security Layer (Authentication, Middleware, CSRF)
- Ensures **system safety and access control**
- Uses Django’s authentication system for session management
- CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Middleware handles request filtering, sessions, and permissions
- Prevents unauthorized access to events and chatrooms

---

### 🗄️ Data Layer (MySQL via Django ORM)
- Manages **data persistence and retrieval**
- MySQL stores users, events, comments, and chat messages
- Django ORM abstracts raw SQL queries
- Ensures **data consistency, integrity, and portability**
