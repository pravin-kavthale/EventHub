## 🧠 Personalized Event Recommendation System

MyEventHub implements a **rule-based personalization engine** that ensures each user sees events in a **unique order** based on their previous interactions.

---

### 🎯 Personalization Signals Used

- **Liked Events**  
  Increases preference for similar events in future recommendations.

- **Joined Events**  
  Strongly boosts the recommendation score for related events.

- **Category Affinity**  
  Events from categories the user frequently interacts with are ranked higher.

---

### Personalization Scoring Logic

Each event receives a **personalization score** per user using the formula: Score = (3 × Joined) + (2 × Liked)

Events are dynamically sorted in **descending order of personalization score**, ensuring that the most relevant events appear first for each user.

---

### Key Characteristics

- Different users see different event orders  
- Personalization is computed dynamically per request  
- Lightweight and fully explainable (no ML models)
- Designed to perform efficiently for small-to-medium scale datasets
  


## Information Retrieval (IR) Based Search System

Search is implemented using **PostgreSQL Full-Text Search (FTS)**, not Django ORM filtering.

---

### How Search Works

- PostgreSQL native **Full-Text Search**
- Text is converted to `tsvector` using `to_tsvector`
- Indexed fields:
  - `title`
  - `description`
- Query parsing via `plainto_tsquery`
- Ranking performed using **`ts_rank_cd` relevance scoring**
- Optimized with a **GIN index**

---

### Why This Matters

| Traditional ORM Search | EventHub Search |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `LIKE '%text%'` | Full-text token search |
| Full table scan | GIN-indexed lookup |
| No ranking | Relevance-based ranking |
| Slow at scale | Optimized and scalable |

---

### Example SQL Used

```sql
SELECT id,
       ts_rank_cd(
         to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(description,'')),
         plainto_tsquery('english', %s)
       ) AS rank
FROM "Event_event"
WHERE to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(description,'')) @@
      plainto_tsquery('english', %s)
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 20;

```
## Search vs Recommendation: Clear Separation of Concerns

| Feature | 🔍 Search System (FTS) | 🧠 Personalized Feed |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 🎯 Purpose | Explicit user query | Event discovery |
| 🛠️ Technique | PostgreSQL FTS + relevance ranking | Rule-based scoring |
| 🗄️ Database Use | Inverted text index (GIN) | Relational joins |
| 📊 Ordering | Relevance score | Personalization score |
| ⚡ Performance | Very fast | Acceptable for current scale |

---

## Index Consistency & Maintenance

- Search index is maintained automatically by **PostgreSQL**
- GIN index stays consistent on:
  - **INSERT**
  - **UPDATE**
  - **DELETE**
- No manual triggers or background re-indexing required

This reduces application complexity and improves reliability.

## ⚙️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="output/Eventhub_Architecture.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="700">
</p>

### Presentation Layer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Responsible for **user interaction and UI rendering**
- Built using **Django templates**
- Displays events, comments, and chat messages
- Sends user actions (login, join event, send message) to the backend via **HTTP requests**
- Contains **no business logic** — only data rendering and form submission

---

### Application Layer (Django Views, URLs)
- Acts as the **request–response controller**
- Django views receive HTTP requests from the frontend
- URL routing maps requests to appropriate views
- Handles **form validation, request parsing, and response generation**
- Serves as the **bridge between UI and business logic**

---

### Business Logic Layer (User App & Event App)
- Personalized recommendation logic based on user interactions (likes and participation)
- Separate pipelines for search (IR-based) and browsing (personalization-based)
- Core layer where **application rules are enforced**
- Structured into two Django apps:
  - **User App**: authentication, authorization, user profiles
  - **Event App**: event creation, joining, comments, and chat access
- Enforces rules such as:
  - Only joined users can access chatrooms
  - Comments can be enabled or disabled per event
- Keeps **domain logic separate** from views and templates

---

### Security Layer (Authentication, Middleware, CSRF)
- Ensures **system safety and access control**
- Uses Django’s authentication system for session management
- CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Middleware handles request filtering, sessions, and permissions
- Prevents unauthorized access to events and chatrooms

---

### Data Layer (PostgreSQL via Django ORM)

- Manages **data persistence and retrieval**
- Uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- Required for:
  - Full-Text Search (FTS)
  - GIN indexing
  - Relevance ranking using `ts_rank_cd`
- Stores:
  - Users
  - Events
  - Categories
  - Comments
  - Likes and participation records
  - Notifications and chat messages
- Hosted as a **managed cloud database on Render**
- Django ORM is used for:
  - Relational queries
  - Model validation
  - Database portability
- Raw SQL is selectively used for **FTS and ranking queries** where ORM is insufficient

This layer ensures **data integrity, performance optimization, and scalable search capabilities**.

---

## Deployment & Production Configuration

MyEventHub is **fully deployed and production-ready**, not just a local development project.

---

## Hosting & Infrastructure

- **Backend Hosting**: Render  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Render Managed Database)  
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary  
- **Static Files**: Whitenoise  
- **Environment**: Production settings with `DEBUG = False`

This setup ensures scalability, reliability, and proper separation of concerns between application logic, media storage, and static assets.

---

## Database (Production)

- **PostgreSQL** used as the production database
- Hosted as a **managed Render PostgreSQL service**
- Supports **Full-Text Search, GIN indexing, and relevance ranking**


---

## Media & Static File Handling

| Asset Type | Technology Used | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Media Files (event images, profile images) | Cloudinary | Cloud-based storage and optimized delivery |
| Static Files (CSS, JS) | Whitenoise | Efficient static file serving in production |

- Media files are **not stored on the server**
- Static assets are compressed and cached via Whitenoise
- No dependency on external web servers like Nginx for static file handling

---

## ⚡ AJAX-Based Interactive Features

To improve user experience and responsiveness, MyEventHub uses **AJAX** for key interactions.

### 🔁 Instant Actions (No Page Reload)

- ❤️ Like / Unlike Event  
- 🤝 Join / Leave Event  
- 🔔 Notification updates  

These actions:
- Send asynchronous requests to Django views  
- Update the UI instantly  
- Reduce server load and unnecessary page reloads  

---

## QR-Based Event Authorization System

To ensure secure verification of event participants, MyEventHub includes a **QR code–based authorization mechanism**.

### How It Works

- When a user joins an event, a **unique QR code** is generated  
- The QR code is:
  - Linked to the user–event relationship
  - Non-transferable
- Event organizers can **scan the QR code at the venue**
- Only **verified joined users** are authorized for access

### Purpose & Benefits

- Prevents unauthorized entry  
- Eliminates fake or duplicate participation  
- Adds a real-world security layer to a digital system  
- Bridges online event management with offline validation
